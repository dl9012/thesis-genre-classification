Nikté,2009,Drama,"This is not your average Disney flick and it's more along the lines of ""Shrek"" humor. I think the previous reviewer was a little harsh on the film considering the industry has evolved and so have kids. While your typical Disney cartoon draws out the drama- Nikte keeps it cool. Suspense is short, doesn't drag like many ""blockbusters"" nowadays, and it's a barrel of laughs. I remember seeing ""UP!"" and thinking, ""so clever!"" I had the same reaction to this film numerous times. The production team managed to intertwine the characters with old pre-columbian myths and folktales and spice it up with modern humor which is really what carries Nikté. While the choices for voice casting seem pretty fitting, yes, there can always be a better voice actor. In this case I find the voice acting pretty efficient nothing severely distracting, but it could have been better. Overall, the kids enjoyed it- they thought it was hilarious! From that perspective, it doesn't matter how annoying adults find it- if the kids think it's funny then ANIMEX banks! We're also happy to see ANIMEX working a short-concise storyline around Mexican heritage. Personally, I had not seen anything this original in a while and this film is a worthwhile effort. Looking forward to see more!"

Akkarakazhchakal - The Movie,2011,Drama,"Viewers of sitcom 'Akkarakazhchakal' that gained popularity almost 7-8 years ago are sure to remember the antics of George Thekkumoottil and the rest of the gang that turned our bad days around. The characters were so relatable and the wackiness was every bit the kind we used to see (or still see) in some of our expat households.While it took nearly 6 years for the film to make it to YouTube, the interest levels had never really died down. An episode or two of A.K before going to sleep had become an inevitable part of some of us Malayalees' late-night diet. The continuity factor is kept intact with almost the entire cast returning to play their much-adored characters (including Appachan, Rincy, Achan, Shiny, Jacob Embranthiri, Ikkili Chacko, the awesome foursome of Babykuttan, Mahi, Krish and Baiju and so on!) except for Mathaikunju and Chacki (played by different child actors). The movie resumes a little further from where EP 50 had ended and the ensemble still manages to rake in ample amount of laughs (some exceptionally memorable one-liners!) while retaining the exact same vibe of the sitcom. None of the characters have really changed in terms of appearance or behavior. There is a severe lack of a central thread that is bound to move the story forward yet there's enough to keep A.K fans satisfied..and DEFINITELY!While the fanboy in me is still yearning for more laughs to be generated from these characters in future, it is certain that Abi Varghese and Ajayan Venugopalan seem to be very clear on how they want the legacy of this sitcom to be upheld, and hence would never want to resort to senseless milking for the sake of repeating success. Fans of A.K are sure to have a great time watching A.K - The Movie and discussing some of the most hilarious moments. How they are still able to cook up new characters/situations and preserve the comedic halo of some of the existing ones is beyond me. Thanking the writer-director duo once again for this wonderful effort!"

Kill the Moonlight,1994,Drama,"This is a strange movie, but also one which is strangely good. I bought it mainly because I like motor racing and it sounded good on the cover, thinking it would be a sort of ""Days of Thunder"" meets ""Napoleon Dynamite"". Actually, it was more like another of my favourate movies, ""Repo Man"". The central character, Chance, is a slacker type guy who wants to be a stock car racer. Unfortunately his car needs a new engine, and he has no money. The movie follows his various attempts to raise money, by taking a variety of slightly bizarre jobs, selling drugs and stealing. Along the way he is poisoned by toxic waste, sleeps with his friend's girlfriend and tries to win back his estranged wife. As well as money, Chance also lacks intelligence, meaning that most of his money-raising attempts end in him being conned, busted, or injured. The funny thing is, although he says ""I'm gonna be a winner"", he's such a slacker he never actually focuses his mind on his objective.Overall, it's a good movie, with some great and slightly surreal scenes, good dialogue and strangely empathetic characters. It's low budget, so don't expect amazing cinematography, but its heart is in the right place and there are some interesting ideas. As a bonus, it features a great soundtrack with some good slacker tunes including some from a (pre-famous) Beck, who was in the band ""Loser"" with the movie's director."

The Mayor, Réal Fournier, would sell out the townsfolk in his attempts to lure industry to the town, still with no takers.
