How to Stuff a Woodpecker,1960,Comedy,"Was very fond of Woody Woodpecker and his cartoons as a child. Still get much enjoyment out of them now as a young adult, even if there are more interesting in personality cartoon characters and better overall cartoons.That is in no way knocking Woody, because many of his cartoons are a lot of fun to watch and more and also still like him a lot as a character. He's fun and is a pest without being too obnoxious, but, like a lot of his later cartoons, compared to his original manic personality he is too toned down and subdued. This undermines the conflict, sad because despite the action being very over-familiar and repetitive Professor Strudel has his amusing and wonderfully nuts moments.Paul J. Smith directs here and there are the same strengths and flaws of most of his output (let alone his Woody Woodpecker outings) here in 'How to Stuff a Woodpecker'. Starting with the strengths, the music is bouncy, energetic and very lushly orchestrated, not only synchronising and fitting with the action very well but enhancing it. There is some energy, the cartoon starts off well, a couple of parts are amusing (especially the ending) and occasionally there are some nice colours.Voice acting is solid. Grace Stafford continues to prove why she was the best voice actor for the character and the one that understood him the most. Dal McKennon is every bit as impressive.However, 'How to Stuff a Woodpecker' is let down by the lack of energy, the conflict not being strong enough, Woody being too subdued and also that it is not very funny. Plus the story is very over-familiar, very few surprises here apart from at the end. Likewise with Woody's antics, which are very typical and the professor's outwitting attempts are nothing new and done with a lack of energy.Just as problematic is the animation quality. Time and budget constraints shows in a lot of the animation, which is very rushed looking in the drawing and detail wise it's on the simplistic and careless side like many of Woody's cartoons from this period continuing through to the 60s. 'How to Stuff a Woodpecker' only sporadically entertains (if more the surprise ending and the professor character) and for a ""How to..."", indicating a cartoon with some educational value, cartoon it fails to teach.In summary, average Woody Woodpecker fare. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of ""as you wish"" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts.

His will also has a non-binding codicil to reunite the last team he coached to curl in the Golden Broom Bonspiel in town, a Long Bay team which has never won and that team which was the closest ever to doing so. Donald wants that specific stone in which he is buried to be delivered as the final shot to sit on the button for the win for the Long Bay team. Beyond the four team members not having curled at all since their last bonspiel ten years ago, they each have issues in their lives which may make coming together as a team and winning, and curling in its entirety difficult or a non-priority. Lead Neil Bucyk's life is directed by his controlling wife Linda, a right she believes she has as his livelihood is in her family's business, a funeral home. Second Eddie Strombeck and his wife Lilly are trying to conceive, her ovulation cycles which may trump all else in his life especially as they have long tried to have a baby without success (although they are having a good time in the trying). Third James Lennox, who has recently returned to town with Joanne, the latest in a long line of not too bright casual and short term girlfriends, is a drug dealer whose biggest priority may be to evade the thugs to who he owes a lot of money. But the biggest question mark may be skip Chris Cutter, who unilaterally made the decision to break up the team when he left town to work in the Alberta oil patch. He quit curling over guilt in not reporting a burnt rock in that last bonspiel, that rock which he ultimately threw into Long Bay (i.e. the rock in which Donald is now buried). The issue of skill may be somewhat addressed if Chris is willing to reconnect with his father and Donald's friend, Gordon Cutter, with who Chris has been estranged over family issues but who remains the most knowledgeable curler in town. The other part of the skill issue is that the Butte team will be curling in the bonspiel, their entire team, but especially skip Alexander Yount, who are treated like rock stars in the curling world. If Chris remains in town to curl, he also has to address some personal issues, as his departure ten years ago broke up his relationship with Donald's daughter, Julie Foley, that adversity which in part led to she coming out ahead professionally as a member now of the space program. However, Donald's other daughter, single mother physiotherapist and admitted alcoholic Amy Foley, who was Chris' drinking buddy and is everyone's best friend, has always had feelings for Chris herself, something of which Chris and Julie, deep in their hearts, are aware."

But Bobby knows he has to get Kit to scream the closing lines of the movie ""gotcha suckas"" for the movie to be a success. Complications ensue when another of the the actors, Carol, tries to go against Bobby's policy of not making contact with Kit outside of filming, and when Bobby is required to hire a production assistant cum stunt double cum acting double, whose job in part is to stand-in for the requisite Kit Ramsey naked ass shot.

Reserviert für den Tod,1963,Thriller,"The proper translation of this movie title would be ""Reserved for Death"". This is a neat little cloak-and-dagger spy story shot in glorious black and white and released in 1963 at the height of the Cold War. What makes this movie different is that it was produced in East Germany! Here is the basic set up: Erich Becker (played by Hans-Peter Minetti) is a former East German national living in Stockholm, Sweden. He flies to Frankfurt in West Germany to meet someone about a job. We learn that Erich will have to take a night train to Erfuhrt, East Germany and meet a certain Dr. Jadenburg (played by Martin Flörchinger) and then bring him back to West Germany. Erich is given false papers with an assumed name so the East German authorities will not know. Clearly, this job is spy mission on behalf of the West German government!Once Erich is on the train, he meets a young woman named Hanna (played by Irma Münch) who knows about the plan. She then reveals other details that give Erich doubts about continuing. A reluctant spy, he considers getting off the train before it enters East Germany. But the last stop before crossing the border is quickly approaching! Are any other spies involved? Who can Erich really trust? And are the East Germans already aware of this mission and setting up a trap? On the face of it, this looks like a classic 1960's spy movie of the ""Smiley"" variety. Some might consider it a propaganda film, but this viewer disagrees. The depiction of West Germany (using stock footage and their own props) seems fair and accurate. At the border, both the western and eastern customs officials were presented as polite and efficient (properly German, in other words.) With that said, the ""Bad Guys"" are definitely those people who sent Erich Becker into East Germany on a dangerous mission.It is important to know that at the time this movie was made, the Berlin Wall had just been erected. The official position of the East German government was that the border was sealed to protect their own citizens against Fascism and Aggression, primarily coming from the United States. West Germany might have more luxuries, but its politics were bankrupt. Yes, some people might be lured away from East Germany by promises of money, but it came at a moral cost. Any film made in East Germany that did not agree with this view would simply not be released. And any foreign films that depicted East Germany in a negative way would never be shown there. Censorship in East Germany was a constant way of life...Of some interest here is that the two primary actors in this movie, Hans-Peter Minetti and Irma Münch, were married in real life and had a son, Daniel. Born in 1958, Daniel Minetti is also an actor who is currently working. Hans-Peter enjoyed a long productive career in East Germany until 1990, at which point the regime collapsed. Thereafter, he received a lot of criticism for his strong support of East Germany. No more major roles for him!"
Repulsion,1965,Thriller,"In London, Belgian immigrant Carol Ledoux shares an apartment with her older sister Helen, and works as a manicurist at a beauty salon. Helen uses the word ""sensitive"" to describe Carol's overall demeanor, which is almost like she walks around in a daze, rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up, it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses, such as Helen's boyfriend Michael's invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work. There, she is almost hypnotized by her solitude, which leads to her mental state deteriorating as those obsessions come to the fore. She quickly descends into madness, which ultimately also affects those that are trying to get in touch with her."
