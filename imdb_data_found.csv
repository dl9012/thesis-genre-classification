Oh Schuks ... I'm Gatvol!,2004,Comedy,"I first saw this movie when it came out in 2004 and thought it was very funny. Then I realised it was funny to only a certain extent. I also discovered early on how tight the budget for this film was. If you're a huge fan of Shuster, then by all means watch this film over and over again. If your not, watch it once, then return it. Trust me, if you watch it twice the Term, 'Bad Movie' is redifined. Go to your local DVD store today and check out this film but return it as soon as the film is over. Watching it once will give you enough laughs, but twice kills the whole thing as the jokes already feel old and boring. If you do not like this Shuster movie then try and find Panic Mechanic, which has twice the laughs and a much better storyline. Overall I can conclude saying Leon Shuster is an excellent prankster but sometimes goes overboard. Like i said, go see this movie if you are South African."

Kill the Moonlight,1994,"Drama, Music","This is a strange movie, but also one which is strangely good. I bought it mainly because I like motor racing and it sounded good on the cover, thinking it would be a sort of ""Days of Thunder"" meets ""Napoleon Dynamite"". Actually, it was more like another of my favourate movies, ""Repo Man"". The central character, Chance, is a slacker type guy who wants to be a stock car racer. Unfortunately his car needs a new engine, and he has no money. The movie follows his various attempts to raise money, by taking a variety of slightly bizarre jobs, selling drugs and stealing. Along the way he is poisoned by toxic waste, sleeps with his friend's girlfriend and tries to win back his estranged wife. As well as money, Chance also lacks intelligence, meaning that most of his money-raising attempts end in him being conned, busted, or injured. The funny thing is, although he says ""I'm gonna be a winner"", he's such a slacker he never actually focuses his mind on his objective.Overall, it's a good movie, with some great and slightly surreal scenes, good dialogue and strangely empathetic characters. It's low budget, so don't expect amazing cinematography, but its heart is in the right place and there are some interesting ideas. As a bonus, it features a great soundtrack with some good slacker tunes including some from a (pre-famous) Beck, who was in the band ""Loser"" with the movie's director."
